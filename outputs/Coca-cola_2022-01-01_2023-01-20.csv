This is the fundamental difference                  …. The taste. Both drinks are sugar free and calorie free. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar looks and tastes more like Coca-Cola Classic, while Coca-Cola Light has a different blend of flavors which gives it a lighter taste.

My brother I don't know the hotel you worked in benin or when you worked at Coca-Cola that you were segregated by tribe.  First Edo state is a state that sees everyone as equal, tribe doesn't have a sit . No tribalism in benin. Secondly Edo state is not a yoruba speaking state .
