Is this person very young or something? Pepsi blue was very popular. Also, I only see them saying that the blue coloring is better than red, not that the other products existed. I suppose the context is missing here.

I don’t think I’ve ever seen video of that Branyan home run. I only heard it described. I believe that was the homer that hit the Pepsi ball on the light tower of the Pepsi porch. Accounts from knowledgeable viewers suggest it would’ve landed across the street at Tiger Stadium.

Probably depends on the pub. City center after work pubs probably make their money from booze. But a lot of the price of the alcohol goes to taxman, e.g. every bottle of gin is about £12 in duty and that's before the 20% VAT. So margins probably thinner than food/pepsi etc?

Yes we were talking about the size. Why do you think we've been sticking to 16 or 16.9 oz for the Gatorade, water and prime sizes. So we get the prices for that amount. Pepsi will be more expensive at the same amount of oz as water but cheaper when it's lower in oz. Very simple",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/SatanicFurry/status/1479209076865347589

Omg. You have to be trolling. We have been talking about bottles this entire time. Why would I be talking about buying single cans of pepsi. Something with a lower amount will cost cheaper idiot. A 16.9oz bottle of pepsi is more expensive than a 16.9 oz bottle of water.

A 12oz can of pepsi will be cheaper than an average 16.9 oz of water. It's more liquid lol. A bottle of pepsi close to the amount of water is more expensive. Also

You do realize better ingredients lead to different prices. A bottle of water will always be cheaper than something like pepsi. This drink has more electrolytes than Gatorade, it includes bcaa which Gatorade doesn't, it has coconut water in all of them.

after seeing how much $bynd has outperformed its two biggest legacy competitors during the pandemic, maple leaf foods and kellog, i'm basically more confident than ever that the plant based meat market will belong to beyond meat and impossible, with beyond in 1st place.

The barriers to entry to this market are just so low that even if you lead the disruption like $BYND you can still lose out.

7 Jan 2022",": Crystal Pepsi and Zesty Salsa Doritos were my go-to snack and drink when I was a kid. I loved both of those items.

But due to poor sales, both products were pulled from the market. As crazy as this made may come across, I still think Zesty Salsa is best Doritos chip ever made.

Pepsi is bringing back Crystal Pepsi for a limited-time run to celebrate its 30-year anniversary.

I've seen interesting debates from people about backing projects on Kickstarter. On one side their crypto currency is not good at all, but on the other the creators get hurt by people leaving not KS.
So my question is would you still back a project by an artist you like via KS?

You don't understand because you don't ship it either.

It's like shipping Adam and Eve but rejecting Book 1: Genesis. Doesn't make sense. Shipping without knowledge of, and respect & gratitude for the source material and its author is disingenuous. That's the gate I keep.

Regular: Slight preference for Pepsi

In a Slurpee: Vanilla Coke or Lemon Pepsi

Perhaps a bit unpopular, but corn syrup cola is usually better than cane syrup cola... Despite what some aficionados will tell you...

I had Astra for jabs and Pfizer for booster. Also bear in mind I have had covid.

Advice for 2nd dose is drink some coke/Pepsi and paracetamol. That works from people I have spoken to (or seems to). I’d call Doctor if you are worried
